# Neural-Network-in-C-
A neural network implemented in C++ which details the essential math behind it such as calculation of gradients and the feedforward matrix multiplication.

A very intuitive program in C++ that implements a multi layered neural network that caluclates the feedforward values and the gradient values.
The user has bee given the option to fine tune the number of perceptrons, number of hidden layers and even the values of the kernel matrix that is initialized.

Run:
g++ nn.cpp
./a.out
